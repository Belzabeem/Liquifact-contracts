# LiquiFact Escrow Contract – Threat Model & Security Notes

Soroban smart contracts for **LiquiFact** — the global invoice liquidity network on Stellar.
This repo contains the **escrow** contract that holds investor funds for tokenized invoices until settlement.

---

## Threat Model

### 1. Unauthorized Access

**Risk:**
- Anyone can call `fund` or `settle`

**Impact:**
- Malicious settlement
- Fake funding events

**Mitigation (Current):**
- None (mock auth used in tests)

**Recommended Controls:**
- Require auth:
  - `fund`: investor must authorize
  - `settle`: only trusted role (e.g. admin/oracle)

---

### 2. Arithmetic Risks (Overflow / Underflow)

**Risk:**
- `funded_amount += amount` may overflow `i128`

---

### 3. Replay / Double Execution

```bash
git clone <this-repo-url>
cd liquifact-contracts
cargo build
cargo test
```

---

### 5. Invalid Input / Economic Attacks

**Risks:**
- Negative funding
- Zero funding
- Invalid maturity

```

Records an investor contribution. Transitions to `status = 1` when
`funded_amount >= funding_target`.

> **Production note:** Must be called atomically with a SEP-41 token `transfer`
> from `investor` to the contract address. This version records accounting only.

**Parameters**

| Parameter   | Constraints                                  |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `_investor` | Investor's Stellar address (for audit trail) |
| `amount`    | > 0 recommended; partial funding is allowed  |

- **init** — Create an invoice escrow (invoice id, SME address, amount, yield bps, maturity). Emits `init` event.
- **get_escrow** — Read current escrow state.
- **get_version** — Return the stored schema version number.
- **fund** — Record investor funding; status becomes "funded" when target is met.
- **settle** — Mark escrow as settled (buyer paid; investors receive principal + yield).
- **migrate** — Upgrade storage from an older schema version to the current one (see below).

### Maturity gate

`settle` enforces two guards before advancing status to `settled (2)`:

1. **Funding check** — `status` must equal `1` (fully funded). Attempting to settle an unfunded escrow panics with `"Escrow must be funded before settlement"`.
2. **Time check** — `env.ledger().timestamp()` must be **≥ `maturity`**. Attempting to settle before the invoice is due panics with `"Cannot settle before maturity timestamp"`.

`env.ledger().timestamp()` is the canonical Soroban on-chain clock. It is set by the Stellar network and **cannot be manipulated by the contract caller**, making it safe to use as a time gate.

| Ledger time vs maturity | Status | Result |
|-------------------------|--------|--------|
| `now < maturity`        | funded | panic — premature settlement blocked |
| `now == maturity`       | funded | success |
| `now > maturity`        | funded | success |
| any                     | open   | panic — not yet funded |

Setting `maturity = 0` effectively disables the time lock (any timestamp ≥ 0).

---

### Events

The contract emits Soroban events on every state-changing call, enabling off-chain indexers and analytics.

| Method   | Topics                   | Payload fields                                   |
|----------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `init`   | `["init", invoice_id]`   | `sme_address`, `amount`, `yield_bps`, `maturity` |
| `fund`   | `["fund", invoice_id]`   | `investor`, `amount`, `funded_amount`, `status`  |
| `settle` | `["settle", invoice_id]` | `sme_address`, `amount`, `yield_bps`             |

All payload types (`InitEvent`, `FundEvent`, `SettleEvent`) are exported `#[contracttype]` structs — see [`escrow/src/lib.rs`](escrow/src/lib.rs) for full field documentation.

The `invoice_id` in the topic allows indexers to filter events by invoice without decoding the payload.

The contract rejects `migrate` calls that:
- Pass a `from_version` that does not match the stored version (prevents accidental double-migration).
- Pass a `from_version >= SCHEMA_VERSION` (already up to date).

### Security notes

- **Re-initialization guard** — `init` panics if the escrow is already initialized, preventing state overwrite.
- **`migrate` must be admin-gated in production** — the current implementation is open for testability. Before mainnet deployment, add `admin_address.require_auth()` at the top of `migrate` so only the contract deployer can trigger upgrades.
- **No silent data loss** — migration arms must explicitly handle every field. Defaulting a field to zero/false is intentional and must be documented in the version history table above.
- **Immutable history** — old migration arms should never be removed; they ensure any instance at any historical version can be brought forward step-by-step.

---

## Security & Authorization

Currently, the contract methods (`init`, `fund`, `settle`) **do not enforce authorization** via `require_auth()`. They rely solely on state-machine guards (e.g. checking if `status == 0` before funding).

> **Warning:** This represents an authentication gap. Any caller can trigger these functions. Negative tests have been added to track this gap and ensure proper exceptions are thrown when the contract is in an invalid state.

---


## Funding Constraints
- **Minimum Funding:** All funding amounts must be strictly greater than zero ($> 0$). 
- **Initialization:** Escrow creation will fail if the target amount is not positive.
- **Integer Safety:** Uses `checked_add` to prevent overflow during funded amount accounting.
- **Governance Controls (Target Update):** The funding target size (`amount`) can be modified by the initialized `admin`. It enforces strict governance constraints: it can only be modified when the escrow is `Open` (status = 0), the new target must be strictly positive, and it can never be less than the existing `funded_amount`.

---

## Security Assumptions

- Soroban runtime guarantees:
- Deterministic execution
- Storage integrity
- Token transfers handled externally
- Off-chain systems validate invoice authenticity

---

---

## Invariants

- `funded_amount <= funding_target` (soft enforced)
- `status transitions`: 0 → 1 → 2
- Cannot settle before funded
| Step | Command | Fails if… |
|------|---------|-----------|
| Format | `cargo fmt --all -- --check` | any file is not formatted |
| Build | `cargo build` | compilation error |
| Tests | `cargo test` | any test fails |
| Coverage | `cargo llvm-cov --features testutils --fail-under-lines 95` | line coverage < 95 % |

### Coverage gate

The pipeline uses [`cargo-llvm-cov`](https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-llvm-cov) (installed via `taiki-e/install-action`) to measure line coverage and hard-fail the job when it drops below **95 %**.

To run the coverage check locally:

```bash
# Install once
cargo install cargo-llvm-cov

# Run (requires llvm-tools-preview component)
rustup component add llvm-tools-preview
cargo llvm-cov --features testutils --fail-under-lines 95 --summary-only
```

Keep formatting, tests, and coverage passing before opening a PR.
